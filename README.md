##### Get help - [Q&A](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/discussions/categories/q-a) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/autogpt)

<hr/>


Auto-GPT is an experimental open-source application showcasing the capabilities of the GPT-4 language model. This program, driven by GPT-4, chains together LLM "thoughts", to autonomously achieve whatever goal you set. As one of the first examples of GPT-4 running fully autonomously, Auto-GPT pushes the boundaries of what is possible with AI.



## Features

- 🌐 Internet access for searches and information gathering
- 💾 Long-term and short-term memory management
- 🧠 GPT-4 instances for text generation
- 🔗 Access to popular websites and platforms
- 🗃️ File storage and summarization with GPT-3.5
- 🔌 Extensibility with Plugins

## Limitations

This experiment aims to showcase the potential of GPT-4 but comes with some limitations:

1. Not a polished application or product, just an experiment
2. May not perform well in complex, real-world business scenarios. In fact, if it actually does, please share your results!
3. Quite expensive to run, so set and monitor your API key limits with OpenAI!
